            <p> As we previously stated, Our game is an platformer/adventure game in which we aim to raise awareness with the problem of pollution and global warming (Subjecet to Change)  </p>
            <p> Our approuch to this is to make a game with multiple stages or levels where you would be assigned different tasks such as saving animals and cleaning trash!!  </p>
            <p> Obviously html, css, js, and solidity will be used but we also plan to make use of Python in the form of Django (If it's possible to add React along with Django) and again if possible, C++ for the actual game.</p>
